# DSLP_LAB_5-Edge-Detection-and-Segmentation



  The Canny operator gives the thinnest, cleanest edges because it uses non-maximum suppression to thin edges and hysteresis thresholding to enhance edge continuity.

  The Canny detector outperforms simple gradient filters because it involves multiple stages, including noise reduction, precise edge localization, and effective thresholding.

  Otsu's method relates to histogram-based thresholding by determining an optimal threshold that minimizes intra-class variance while maximizing inter-class variance based on pixel intensity distribution.
